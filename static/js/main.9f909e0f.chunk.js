Additionally, we feel session-based data is more important than historical data while suggesting music during a user\u2019s session.\nEmotion from valence & arousal:\nWe have used valence and arousal values of songs to predict their emotions. As illustrated here, variations in the ratio of the 2 values signify different emotions conveyed in the songs.\nDataset: We used the DEAM dataset \u2013 The MediaEval Database for Emotional Analysis of Music. This contains 1802 songs annotated with valence and arousal values, as well as, the extracted features.\nAudio Feature Extraction: Using Python\u2019s librosa library, we extracted 14 MFCC features for every 2 seconds of the first 60 seconds of an mp3 file with a sampling rate of 22,050. The adjacent graph shows the normalized values of features for songs of different emotions.\nRecommendation system: We set up our recommender system to find out the top 10 songs most similar to the current song user is listening to.

Quick, Draw! was released as an experimental game to educate the public in a playful way about how AI works. The game prompts users to draw an image depicting a certain category, such as banana, table, etc. The game generated more than 1B drawings, of which a subset was publicly released as the basis for this competitions training set. That subset contains 50M drawings encompassing 340 label categories. Using this classified dataset, I built a classifier to assign hand-drawn doodles from my application into unique categories. This task is tricky due to the wide variation of doodles within even a single category, and confusing similarity between doodles across multiple categories.\nDataset: I am using the Quick Draw Doodle Dataset from Kaggle. It is a collection of millions of drawings across 340 categories. The drawings were captured as timestamped vectors, tagged with metadata including what the player was asked to draw and in which country the player was located. Two versions of the data are given. The raw data is the exact input recorded from the user drawing, while the simplified version removes unnecessary points from the vector information. (For example, a straight line may have been recorded with 8 points, but since you only need 2 points to uniquely identify a line, 6 points can be dropped.) The simplified files are much smaller and provide effectively the same information.\nPreprocessing: I used the simplified version of the dataset for my model. As mentioned before, the drawings were captured as timestamped vectors. Each drawing was composed of stroke information, and not as actual doodle images. Therefore, I had to convert them into images by drawing the strokes on a plot and then saving them as images. The images were normalized with size 256 \xd7 256.\nResidual Networks: A residual neural network (ResNet) is a neural network of a kind that builds on constructs known from pyramidal cells in the cerebral cortex. To avoid problems like the vanishing gradient problem and saturation and degradation of accuracy with increasing network depths, residual networks skips over some layers. Skipping effectively simplifies the network, using fewer layers in the initial training stages. This speeds learning by reducing the impact of vanishing gradients, as there are fewer layers to propagate through. The network then gradually restores the skipped layers as it learns the feature space. Towards the end of training, when all layers are expanded, it stays closer to the manifold[clarification needed] and thus learns faster. These residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. ResNet models provide very high accuracies with affordable model sizes. They are ideal for cases when high accuracy of classification is required.\nResNet-34: ResNet-34 is an ensemble of 34-layes of residual networks that has been pretrained on the ImageNet dataset. The reason why resnet34 is used is because its performance to accuracy trade off is fine for image recognition is good. The architecture of Resnet34 along with it\u2019s sizes is given below.\nOne Cycle Training: In the paper, Leslie Smith describes an approach to set hyper-parameters (namely learning rate, momentum and weight decay) and batch size. In particular, he suggests 1 Cycle policy to apply learning rates. The author recommends to do one cycle of learning rate of 2 steps of equal length. We choose maximum learning rate using range test. We use lower learning rate as 1/5th or 1/10th of maximum learning rate. We go from lower learning rate to higher learning rate in step 1 and back to lower learning rate in step 2. We pick this cycle length slightly lesser than total number of epochs to be trained. And in last remaining iterations, we annihilate learning rate way below lower learning rate value(1/10 th or 1/100 th).\nThe motivation behind this is that, during the middle of learning when learning rate is higher, the learning rate works as regularisation method and keep network from overfitting. This helps the network to avoid steep areas of loss and land better flatter minima.\nBaseline: Since the dataset consists of 340 classes and more than 20,000 images for each class, I initially create a working baseline model with a small subset of classes. Therefore, I trained the data on 500 images each for 10 classes with the ResNet-34 pretrained model. The training was run for 30 epochs using the One-Cycle training method. I was able to achieve a training accuracy of 95% and validation accuracy of 92% for this baseline model.\nImproving The Model: For my model, I decided to go with 50 classes of doodles that can be input by the user. Therefore, I trained the model on 500 images each of the 50 classes for 30 epochs. As seen in the architecture above, the ResNet-34 model has 3 layer groups. I additionally unfroze the last layer group in the model completely so that the model performs better on my data.",links:[{link_name:"Website",link_url:"https://doodle-recognition.onrender.com/"},{link_name:"GitHub",link_url:"https://github.com/AkshayeAnithaPradeep/DoodleRecogniton-NeuralNet"}]},6:{name:"Person Reidentification in the Wild",desc:"Person re-identification in the wild involves finding targeted people across different space-time locations, where occlusion and body postures pose significant challenges.

We build a residual attention network, which can incorporate with state-of-art feed forward network architecture in an end-to-end training fashion, that can detect features that stand out which can then be used to classify the image. Additionally, we are planning to use Refined Part Pooling to match outliers incurred during the attention based partitioning and assigns them to the parts they most closely  match, thereby enhancing consistency within the parts they are assigned to.
